# Java-Streama-Challenge
Kick off project for Java engineer qualification

Solitaire is planning to incorporate the Streama media server into its Atlas project. Streama was chosen because it is 
open source under an MIT license, and appears to have the basic requirements to serve as a foundation for the video
streaming component of the Atlas project.

Solitaire does not currently have an engineer with Java skills to modify the application in the time frame that 
is needed to satisfyth the project time lines. While the listed taske are relatively trivial, they will help us 
determine whether a candidate has the experience and tools necessary to work on this project. 

# The Required Delivery Items

1. The Streama code modified to:
   a. Change the distributed logos. The logos can be changed from the admin interface
      but, the intent is to replace the imbeded ones.
   b. There are 4 sections in the User Dashboard; "Continue Watching", "Discover Shows", "Discover Movies" 
      and "Discover Other Videos"  We want remove the shows and movies sections and rename the "Discover
      Other Videos" section to be just "Videos".
2. A working replacement for the "streama-1.6.0-RC9.war" file that has been modified as above and compiled.
3. Description of the changes that have been made. This can be a diff of the modified files.

# What you have to work with

The Github repository with the application sources and available documentation is here:

  https://github.com/streamaserver/streama
  
The current released war file can be found from here as well.

A running Streama media server can be found at: http://69.181.95.8:8080. Login as admin with password admin. 
It has the logos replaced so that you can get a good idea of what we are asking for.
